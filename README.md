React 16.3 has a new Context API which makes accessing data and functions anywhere in your application easy. If you ever find yourself passing data down via props 4-5 levels deep, context might be what you are looking for.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
